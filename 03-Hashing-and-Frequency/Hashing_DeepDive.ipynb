    "## 🎓 Part 3: FAANG/MAANG Interview Questions (The \"Why\" & \"How\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are top interview questions based on the concepts from my notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1: Why did we move from Brute Force to Hashing? (The Trade-off Question)\n",
    "**Answer:** In the brute force approach (nested loops), the time complexity is $O(N^2)$, which is too slow for large datasets ($10^8$ elements). By using Hashing, we utilize extra **Space (Memory)** to store counts in a Dictionary or Array. This reduces the time complexity to $O(N)$ for pre-storing and $O(1)$ for fetching. It's a classic **Time-Space Trade-off**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: When should I use an Array vs. a Dictionary for hashing?\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "* **Use Array:** When the elements are integers and their **range is small and known** (e.g., numbers between 1 and 1000, or characters 'a'-'z'). Array indexing is slightly faster and uses less overhead.\n",
    "* **Use Dictionary:** When the range is huge (e.g., numbers up to $10^9$), unknown, or when elements are not integers (e.g., strings). Dictionaries handle sparse data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: Explain the logic behind `ord(ch) - 97` in character hashing.\n",
    "**Answer:** We need to map characters 'a' through 'z' to array indices 0 through 25. Computers store characters as ASCII numbers. 'a' is 97, 'b' is 98, etc. By subtracting the base value of 'a' (97) from any character's ASCII value, we normalize it to start from 0. So, 'a' becomes $97-97=0$, 'b' becomes $98-97=1$. This is a **Direct Addressing Table** technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: What is the worst-case time complexity of Dictionary lookups?\n",
    "**Answer:** While the *average* case is $O(1)$, the **worst-case** is $O(N)$. This happens due to \"Collisions\" (when many different keys hash to the same underlying bucket). However, modern languages (like Python) handle this very efficiently, so we usually assume $O(1)$ in interviews unless specific constraints force a collision scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: Can we optimize space in Character Hashing if the string only has 'a', 'b', and 'c'?\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes. The current logic uses $O(26)$ constant space. If we know for sure only 'a', 'b', 'c' exist, we could use an array of size 3. However, $O(26)$ is already considered $O(1)$ constant space in asymptotic analysis, so further optimization is usually not required unless memory is extremely tight."
