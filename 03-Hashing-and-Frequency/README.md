# 03. Hashing and Frequency Mapping

### 🚀 Overview
This module covers the transition from Brute Force searching to Optimized Hashing. I have applied **O(N) efficiency** standards to handle large datasets.

### 📓 Interactive Presentation
Detailed logic, handwritten notes, and code outputs are available in my interactive notebook:

### 🛠️ Key Learnings:
* **Frequency Mapping:** Using Python Dictionaries for $O(1)$ lookups.
* **Character Hashing:** Optimizing alphabet counts using ASCII manipulation.
* **Complexity:** Reduced time from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$.
