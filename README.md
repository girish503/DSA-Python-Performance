**Architecting High-Efficiency Solutions for AI/ML & Web Systems.**

## 👨‍💻 My Engineering Mindset
This repository documents my systematic approach to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. As a final-year B.Tech (CSE-AI) student and NCC 'C' Cadet, I don't just "solve problems"—I build for performance and reliability.

### 🛠️ The Developer's Standards
* **The $10^8$ Rule:** Every algorithm is designed to stay within the 100-million-operations-per-second limit to ensure zero TLE errors in production.
* **Input Immutability:** Maintaining data integrity by always preserving the original input variable using auxiliary copies.
* **Asymptotic Efficiency:** Prioritizing $O(n \log n)$ and $O(n)$ time complexities over naive approaches.

## 📈 My Learning Process
1. **Conceptual Mastery:** Bridging technical concepts between English and Telugu for 10x faster understanding.
2. **AI Thought Partnership:** Using AI as a senior mentor to break down complex "Why" questions before writing a single line of code.
3. **Professional Documentation:** Every module contains a local README explaining the mathematical logic and complexity benchmarks.
4. **Consistency:** Maintaining a daily "Green Streak" on GitHub and LeetCode to build engineering discipline.
